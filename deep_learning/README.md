# Deep Learning from basics to advances
In this directory, tutorials related to deep learning or specifically neural network models will demonstrate how they function. These tutorials are divided into three levels: **basics**, **intermediate**, and **advanced**.

## Basics
At the **basics** level, we will give you the simplest understanding of how a model processes inputs and produces outputs, as well as how the model updates its weights in order to learn from the data and complete tasks.

The content of the **basics** level includes:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Loss Functions
- Fully-connected Deep Neural Network
- Activation Functions
- Binary Classification
- Multi-classes Classification
- Backpropagation

## Intermediate
At this stage, learners should dive deeper into more complex topics and advanced techniques in neural networks, along with hands-on projects that require more critical thinking.

The content of the **intermediate** level includes:

- Regularization Techniques
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Cross Validation 
- Experiment Tracking
- Hyperparameter Optization (HPO)

## Advanced
The advanced level focuses on cutting-edge technologies and requires learners to understand not just how to use deep learning models, but how to build or innovate on them.

The content of the **advanced** level includes:

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder
- Attention Mechanisms and Transformer
- Vision Transformers
