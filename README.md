# Welcome to the Deep Learning Tutorial Repository

## Introduction
Learning **Machine Learning (ML)** in general and **Deep Learning (DL)** in particular is a long and complex process. This repository is created to assist newcomers in gaining a better understanding of DL, as well as the steps to solve simple tasks. It aims to provide users with a clearer view of DL algorithms. In this repository, most tutorials will be implemented using the **PyTorch** framework.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Linear algebra and statistics
- An endless passion for ML/DL

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
git clone git@github.com:khoaphamanh/deep-learning-tutorial.git
cd deep-learning-tutorial
```
Next, you need to install Anaconda/Miniconda on your computer. After that, create a virtual environment and install the required frameworks using the following commands:
```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
git clone git@github.com:khoaphamanh/deep-learning-tutorial.git
cd deep-learning-tutorial
```
