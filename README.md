# Welcome to the Deep Learning Tutorial Repository

## Introduction
Learning **Machine Learning (ML)** in general and **Deep Learning (DL)** in particular is a long and complex process. This repository is created to assist newcomers in gaining a better understanding of DL, as well as the steps to solve simple tasks. It aims to provide users with a clearer view of DL algorithms. In this repository, most tutorials will be implemented using the **PyTorch** framework.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Linear algebra and statistics
- Previously familiar with the frameworks numpy, pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.
- An endless passion for ML/DL

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
git clone git@github.com:khoaphamanh/deep-learning-tutorial.git
cd deep-learning-tutorial
```
Next, you need to install Anaconda/Miniconda on your computer. After that, create a virtual environment and install the required frameworks using the following commands:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate deep-learning-tutorial
```

## Tutorials
Each tutorial for a specific field will be stored in specific directories such as:
- deep_learning: Focuses on deep learning algorithms from basic to advanced.
- metrics: Metrics to evaluate model performance.
- data_preprocessing: Emphasizes data preprocessing algorithms.
- experiment_tracking: How to visualize model results and performance.
- interpretable_ml: Explains how ML algorithms make decisions.

In each subfolder of the tutorials, there will always be a **README.md** file to describe what we want to convey. Everything will be written in an easy-to-understand manner so that even beginners can approach the problem as easily as possible.
